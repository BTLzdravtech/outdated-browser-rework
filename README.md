# Outdated Browser Rework

Detects outdated browsers and advises users to upgrade to a new version. Handles mobile devices!

This is a fork of [Burocratik](http://www.burocratik.com)'s excellent Outdated Browser, adding a number of new features.

## Usage

### JS

	var outdatedBrowserRework = require("outdated-browser-rework");

	outdatedBrowserRework();

If you like, specify options, eg:

	outdatedBrowserRework({
		browserSupport: {
			'Chrome': 37,
			'IE': 10,
			'Safari': 7,
			'Mobile Safari': 7,
			'Firefox':	32
		}
	});

#### Options

 - __browserSupport__:Object - A matrix of browsers and their major versions - see above for demo. Anything less will be unsupported.
 - __requiredCssProperty__:String - A CSS property that must be supported.
 - __requireChromeOnAndroid__:Boolean - Ask Android users to install Chrome.

### SCSS

	@import "vendor/outdated-browser-rework.scss";

## Differences from Outdated Browser 1.1.0

 - Add explicit browser support via the __browserSupport__ option
 - Add mobile support. Users on iOS and Android will be directed to the Apple App Store and Google Play respectively.
 - Add new __requireChromeOnAndroid__ option
 - Be an NPM module
 - Use SASS (specifically SCSS)
 - No AJAX, languages are only 8K and removing the AJAX library has made the code substantially shorter.

And some code fixes:

 - Pass jshint
 - Remove HTML entities. It's 2015, we have unicode now.
 - Included Vanilla JS onload option - since current jQuery no longer supports old browsers.
 - Simplify some variable and function names

There's still some TODOs from the original code:

 - Try and eliminate IDs
 - Move all styling into SCSS
